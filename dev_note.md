- class capturing
- info
- document
- formatter
- compiler

## capture

- raw class fetching
- event listening, in mixin package
- binding event
- cache IO
- recipe holders, info or capture?

## info

- class walker
  - should add special handling for JS obj
- mostly data class, immutable, like `record`
- (maybe)no logic, except for class walker

## document

- info -> doc, as base
- read external doc
- parse external doc and add into base  
- apply generics  
- method/field filtering

## formatter

just formatter, quite obvious :)

## compiler
